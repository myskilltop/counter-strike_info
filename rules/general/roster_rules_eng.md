>
> Each team competing in a Myskill tournament is encouraged to register substitute players to mitigate possible losses during the event.
>

## Adding a New Player

> **Restrictions on adding new players**
>
> The following restriction applies throughout an event and its qualifiers:

A player who participated in any qualifier—regardless of whether they qualified—may not play in the main tournament for a different team.

> **Roster submission deadline**
>
> The final event line-up must be submitted by the deadline set by the tournament administration (usually 2 days before the first match). The roster must include five (5) starting players, up to two (2) substitutes (if needed) and one (1) coach (if needed). Myskill will recognize contracts or agreements between players and teams that take effect two (2) days before their first match at the tournament.
>
> New players may be added to the roster at any time before the registration deadline, but not after it passes.
>
> Extraordinary situations (for example, medical emergencies) will be handled outside of this rule on a case-by-case basis.

## Emergency Additions and Supplements

If a team is unable to field a full roster due to a serious and unforeseen emergency, the team has the right to submit an emergency player addition request, subject to the provision of supporting documentation.
All emergency player addition requests and supporting documentation will be reviewed by the tournament administration on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on emergency player addition requests are made at the sole discretion of the tournament administration.
Emergency additions remain subject to the restrictions on adding new players. Any additional restrictions described in this rulebook may be waived to facilitate the addition.
If an emergency addition is approved, all costs associated with transporting the new player to the event must be covered by the team.

## Substitutions

> Only players listed on the registered roster are eligible to be substituted. The opposing team and tournament administration must be notified in advance.
>
> **Online event substitutions**
>
> During online competitions, substitutions may be made between maps or, for valid reasons (such as connection issues), at any point during the game. If necessary, the game may be paused for substitutions. The delay must not exceed five (5) minutes. Teams must announce any substitutions between maps at the end of the previous map.
>
> **Offline event substitutions**
>
> Participants are allowed to substitute players between maps of the series or between matches.
Any changes to the starting lineup for the upcoming map must be communicated to the tournament administration after the map pick or immediately after the conclusion of the previous map, whichever comes first.
Substitutes will be required to prepare immediately after the conclusion of the previous map and will not be given additional preparation time.
If this is the first match of an offline tournament, the starting lineup must be communicated to the tournament administration no later than 24 hours before the scheduled start of the match.
>
> **Offline coach substitutions**
>
> Registered participants may substitute the coach standing behind the team during a match. Coach substitutions may only take place between matches and must be reported to the tournament administration after the map veto for the relevant match.
>
> **Roster composition restrictions during the event**
>
> After a team plays its first qualifier match, the roster must contain a majority of the original starting players for the remainder of the tournament.
> This also means that an organization that attempted to qualify with one team but failed may not sign new teams to participate in the tournament.
