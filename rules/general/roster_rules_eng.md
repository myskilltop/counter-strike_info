# Myskill Roster Regulations

> Teams must submit their line-ups for offline and online tournaments by the deadline set by the tournament administration.

- The roster must include five (5) starting players.

- In addition, the roster may include one coach and up to two (2) substitute players.

> All players and coaches will be considered part of the roster even if they have not played a single match.
>
> If a team has not registered the maximum number of substitutes (2), a registered coach may be used as a substitute provided they meet the eligibility requirements to participate in the tournament.
>
> Each team competing in a Myskill tournament is encouraged to register substitute players to mitigate possible losses during the event.
>
> Myskill reserves the right to publish the line-ups of qualified teams as part of its own marketing activities to promote the tournament.

## Adding a New Player

> **Restrictions on adding new players**
>
> The following restriction applies throughout an event and its qualifiers:

A player who participated in any qualifier—regardless of whether they qualified—may not play in the main tournament for a different team.

> **Roster submission deadline**
>
> The final event line-up must be submitted by the deadline set by the tournament administration (usually 2 days before the first match). The roster must include five (5) starting players, up to two (2) substitutes (if needed) and one (1) coach (if needed). Myskill will recognize contracts or agreements between players and teams that take effect two (2) days before their first match at the tournament.
>
> New players may be added to the roster at any time before the registration deadline, but not after it passes.
>
> Extraordinary situations (for example, medical emergencies) will be handled outside of this rule on a case-by-case basis.

## Emergency Additions and Supplements

> If a team cannot field a full roster due to a serious and unforeseen emergency, it may submit a request for emergency player additions provided supporting documentation is supplied.
>
> All requests for emergency additions and supporting documents will be reviewed by the tournament administration on a case-by-case basis. Decisions regarding emergency additions are made at the discretion of the tournament administration.
>
> Restrictions on adding new players continue to apply to emergency additions. Any additional restrictions described in these rules may be waived to facilitate the addition.
>
> If an emergency addition is approved, the team must cover all costs associated with bringing the new player to the event.

## Substitutions

> Only players listed on the registered roster are eligible to be substituted. The opposing team and tournament administration must be notified in advance.
>
> **Online event substitutions**
>
> During online events, substitutions may take place between maps or, with a valid reason (for example, connection issues), at any point during the game. The match may be paused to complete the substitution. The delay may not exceed five (5) minutes. Teams must announce any between-map substitutions at the end of the previous map.
>
> **Offline event substitutions**
>
> Participants may replace players between maps in a series or between matches.
>
> Any changes to the starting roster for an upcoming map must be reported to the tournament administration after the map veto or immediately after the previous map ends, whichever occurs first.
>
> Substitute players must be ready immediately after the previous map ends and will not be given additional warm-up time.
>
> If it is the first match of an offline tournament, the roster must be provided to the tournament administration no later than 24 hours before the scheduled start of the match.
>
> **Offline coach substitutions**
>
> Registered participants may substitute the coach standing behind the team during a match. Coach substitutions may only take place between matches and must be reported to the tournament administration after the map veto for the relevant match.
>
> **Roster composition restrictions during the event**
>
> After a team plays its first qualifier match, the roster must contain a majority of the original starting players for the remainder of the tournament.
> This also means that an organization that attempted to qualify with one team but failed may not sign new teams to participate in the tournament.
