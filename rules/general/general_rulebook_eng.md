# 1. Scope of this Rulebook

The event is organised by the tournament operator Myskill (referred to in this document as “Myskill” and/or the “organiser”) and its affiliated parties.

This rulebook is part of the Myskill Counter-Strike 2 regulations. It applies to Myskill tournaments, their participants and every match played within these competitions. By taking part, participants confirm that they understand and accept all rules.

The regulations consist of three documents:

- Myskill Counter-Strike 2 Rulebook
- Myskill Counter-Strike in-game rules
- Myskill Counter-Strike roster regulations

# 2. Participants

A participant is a team or player competing in a Myskill tournament.

Any member of a team competing in a Myskill tournament is considered part of that team regardless of whether they have played a match for it. No participant may be part of multiple organisations that are taking part in overlapping Myskill Counter-Strike competitions.

All participants must also comply with the current
[Myskill ban list](https://github.com/myskilltop/counter-strike_info/blob/main/banlist/banlist.md).
Breaching this requirement will trigger the sanctions described in this
rulebook.

In exceptional circumstances, a transition period may be granted that allows a participant to finish one competition with their current team while beginning another with a different team.

If you are unsure, contact a tournament administrator to confirm whether a given competition creates a conflict of interest.

# 3. Penalties
## 3.1. Definitions and scope of penalties

Participants may receive penalties for rule infractions during an event. Possible sanctions include penalty points, fines, default losses, disqualification of a player or team, or a combination of these measures depending on the incident. Participants are informed about penalties by email and are given a deadline to appeal. Only the team representative or their appointed delegate may file an appeal.

## 3.2. Penalty points

Penalty points may be issued for competition-related incidents. Each point deducts one percent (1%) of the prize money a participant earns in the competition.

## 3.3. Fines

Fines may be imposed for match-related incidents as well as for failing to meet obligations outside the competition itself, such as media appointments or scheduled fan interactions. If the total fines exceed the prize money earned at the event, the team and/or participant will receive an invoice for the remaining balance.

## 3.4. Bans / suspensions

Severe violations may result in bans or suspensions. These can apply to a participant or to an organisation.

## 3.5. Disqualification

In the most serious cases, participants may be disqualified from the event. Disqualified participants forfeit all prize money earned in the respective competition. The organisation, team and its members are barred from continuing in that competition.

## 3.6. Additional disciplinary measures

In special cases, the tournament administration may determine and apply disciplinary measures not explicitly listed in the Myskill Counter-Strike rules.

## 3.7. Repeated offences

All penalties in this rulebook apply to first offences. Repeat offences are generally punished more severely than indicated in the relevant section.

## 3.8. External bans and penalty points

League bans and penalty points issued outside the Myskill Counter-Strike ecosystem usually do not apply to Myskill events unless they were imposed for cheating. Other serious violations (such as unsportsmanlike conduct or fraud) may also be sanctioned depending on their severity.

# 4. General rules

## 4.1. Rule changes

Myskill reserves the right to amend, remove or otherwise change rules without prior notice. Myskill may also rule on matters not covered by the regulations to uphold fair competition and sportsmanship.

## 4.2. Validity of rules

If any provision of this rulebook is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, this does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or in any other jurisdiction.

## 4.3. Local laws

If a rule or procedure conflicts with local laws, it will be adjusted to comply with the law while staying as close as possible to the intended effect.

## 4.4. Confidentiality

Emails, communication channels, discussions and any other correspondence with officials or tournament administrators are strictly confidential.

Publishing such material is prohibited without the written consent of the tournament administration.

## 4.5. Supplemental agreements

The tournament administration is not responsible for additional agreements and will not enforce arrangements made between participants. Myskill strongly discourages such agreements, and any deal that contradicts the Myskill Counter-Strike rules is prohibited under all circumstances.

# 5. Match broadcasts

## 5.1. Rights

Unless otherwise stated in event supplements, all broadcasting rights for Myskill tournaments belong to Myskill. This includes, but is not limited to, IRC bots, video streams (such as POV broadcasts), CSTV, replays, demos and television broadcasts.

## 5.2. Waiving broadcasting rights

Myskill may grant the broadcasting rights of one or more matches to a third party or to the participants themselves. In these cases, the broadcast must be approved by the Myskill tournament administration at least twenty-four (24) hours before the match starts.

## 5.3. Responsibility of participants

Participants may not refuse to broadcast their matches on channels authorised by Myskill, nor may they choose the broadcast method. Only the tournament administration may allow a match to go unbroadcast. Participants agree to provide all conditions required to produce the broadcast.

# 6. Communication

Email and the Telegram messenger are the primary communication channels for Myskill Counter-Strike tournaments. The tournament administration will use the contact email addresses and Telegram accounts provided by participants.

Discord servers may also be used in online competitions to coordinate matches, manage broadcasts and organise activities. In such cases, the tournament administration will email the relevant server details.

# 7. Eligibility requirements

**The following requirements must be met to take part in the event:**

## 7.1. Age restrictions

There are no age restrictions for participation in the competition.
Players who have not reached the age of eighteen (18) at the time of the first 
mandatory day of the competition (including media days and qualifying stages) 
are only allowed to participate with the written consent of a parent 
or legal representative.

The organizer reserves the right to request a document confirming the identity 
of the participant and/or legal representative, as well as written consent to participate in the tournament.

Translated with DeepL.com (free version)

## 7.2. Country / region of origin

A team’s home region (Central Asia or Rest of the World) is determined by the location of all of its players during the tournament and its qualifiers.

Two (2) regions are defined for the tournament: Central Asia and Rest of the World.

The Central Asia region includes the following countries: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.

# 8. Player data

Players must provide any information requested by Myskill, including full name, contact details, date of birth, address, game account and a photograph.

## 8.1. Nicknames

Players may only use their official nicknames (without additions) in Myskill matches. Players with a Valve-registered nickname for sponsored events or an HLTV page must use the same nickname in all Myskill matches.

Players without a registered nickname may request a change by emailing the tournament administration. Myskill may reject nicknames containing political, religious or offensive content or anything that violates the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

## 8.2. Game accounts

Participants must supply their game account details when applying to enter or on the FACEIT registration page for the event. They must not use any account other than the one submitted for registration.

### Application requirements

Standard applications must include:

- Team name and abbreviation
- Team logo (if requested)
- Contact person and details
- Starting line-up
- Substitute players

Myskill may request additional information. Failure to provide required data may result in exclusion from the tournament.

### Team names

Team names may not include extensions such as “CS team”. They may only contain the team name and, if permitted, the title sponsor. Myskill reserves the right to shorten team names when necessary or appropriate.

Myskill may reject names containing political, religious or offensive content or anything that violates the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

## 8.3. Title sponsors

Myskill may allow a team to include a title sponsor in its name only if the entire organisation changes its name. Participants must contact Myskill directly to request a name change. Requests are evaluated under the following rules:

- The request must be submitted by the roster deadline of the first tournament that should use the new name.
- The organisation must officially adopt the new name and include the title partner in it.
- The organisation must use the new name in all communications and assets.
- All social media channels must be updated with the new name.
- The organisation must use the new name in every event it attends, not just Myskill tournaments.

Each title sponsor may appear in the name of only one organisation participating in the tournament. Only the actual name of the partner is allowed; product descriptions and similar additions are not permitted.

A request to add a title sponsor may be submitted only once within twelve (12) months. Myskill may decline any request at its sole discretion. Participants should consult Myskill to confirm whether a partner is eligible to be included in the organisation’s name.

## 8.4. Team logos

Team logos must not include the logos or iconography of brands, teams or trademarks unrelated to the team unless they belong to an approved title sponsor.

Copyrighted material may only be used with documented permission from the rights holder. Myskill may reject logos that contain political, religious or offensive statements or anything that violates the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

## 8.5. Roster or team changes

Any roster changes must be approved by the tournament administration before they take effect. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Adding or removing players
- Changing the team name
- Changing the team logo

## 8.6. Permission to participate

Before each event, Myskill may issue participation licences to players or teams. These are generally granted to participants who meet one or more of the following criteria:

- Qualified through Myskill regional qualifiers
- Received a direct invitation from the organiser
- Earned a slot via other tournaments or events

## 8.7. Duration

A Myskill licence is valid only for the event for which it is issued.

## 8.8. Team licence

Event licences are issued to legal entities (registered associations, organisations, LLCs, etc.). A legal entity may hold only one licence per competition, and an organisation may field only one roster in the tournament. Teams are strictly forbidden from switching the line-up that represents them during the event.

If a team does not have a legal entity or has not previously reported it to and received approval from the tournament administration, it may receive a limited licence with a team manager or organiser designated as the point of contact. This person is responsible for keeping the team information up to date.

Regardless of licence type, it remains valid only if the majority of the players who qualified or participated in the tournament or qualifiers stay with the team.

If a team has used more than five players during the qualifiers, it must ensure that at least five players from the qualifying roster remain on the team. Additional players may be registered as substitutes if they meet the eligibility criteria.

## 8.9. Transfer of licence ownership

Licences may not be transferred to another legal entity or organisation without written approval from Myskill. Any change of ownership must be reported immediately and may lead to the licence being revoked.

## 8.10. Revoking a licence

Myskill may revoke a licence if the organisation or team breaches the rulebook, fails to meet eligibility requirements or violates applicable laws. In severe cases, the team may be removed from the tournament.

## 8.11. Conflict of interest

Players, coaches and managers must disclose any situations that could create a conflict of interest, such as involvement with multiple organisations or business relationships with other teams. Myskill may impose additional restrictions or deny participation if a conflict of interest is identified.
# 9. Prize money

Prize payments are ideally processed within ninety (90) days after a Myskill event ends, but may take up to one hundred eighty (180) days. Payments will be delayed if accurate billing information, invoices or required documents (including tax forms) are missing.

## 9.1. Prize deductions resulting from penalties

Each penalty point earned during the tournament or its qualifiers removes one percent (1%) of the participant’s prize share. The deduction is calculated from the total prize money awarded for the latest phase of the competition, excluding travel stipends or club fees. The deducted amount is redistributed among the remaining teams. Monetary fines are deducted from the penalised team’s prize share and are not redistributed.

## 9.2. Withholding prize money

Until prize money is paid out, Myskill may cancel any pending payment if evidence of cheating or fraud emerges.

## 9.3. Prize money and ongoing investigations

If a player is under investigation when prize money is due, their payment is postponed until the investigation ends. If the investigation concludes after three years but the player is entitled to prize money, it will still be paid.

## 9.4. Transfer of prize money

Prize money is paid via bank transfer or another method specified by the tournament administration, following the instructions of the licence holder. Unclaimed prizes expire one year after the initial payout date.

## 9.5. Declining to participate

Teams that leave the tournament between stages (including qualifiers and the main event) or after accepting an invitation forfeit all prize money earned and receive a ban from the next event of the same level. They may also be fined to cover replacement costs (travel for the replacement team and other expenses). If Myskill cannot find a replacement, the team’s scheduled matches are voided. Fines may be waived in emergencies such as medical issues or visa problems, provided the team supplies appropriate documentation.

## 9.6. Leaving the event during playoffs

A team that forfeits a playoff elimination match is considered to have left the tournament. If the forfeit happens before the first playoff round, the next best-ranked team from the previous stage replaces them. Later forfeits award the withdrawing team the placement held in the bracket at the time of withdrawal, but only half of the associated prize money, and the team loses eligibility for further rewards. In league formats, withdrawing from playoffs may lead to relegation.

## 9.7. Removal of match results

All matches played by players who leave a tournament stage after it has started are removed from the standings. In playoffs, the withdrawing team’s next scheduled match is recorded as a forfeit win for the opponent.

# 10. Match start

## 10.1. Punctuality in online matches

TAll tournament matches must begin according to the tournament schedule. Any time changes must be approved by the tournament administration and, if necessary, by the opponent (if a change is possible). All match participants must be logged into the game server and ready to play no later than ten (10) minutes before the start of the match. The tournament administration may adjust the time if deemed necessary.

## 10.2. Lateness in online matches

If a participant fails to appear on the server ten (10) minutes before the scheduled start time of the match, they may be assessed one (1) penalty point. If they fail to appear on the server five (5) minutes before the scheduled start time of the match, they may be assessed an additional one (1) penalty point. If the participant still has not appeared on the server and is not ready to play by the scheduled start time of the match, they may be assessed an additional one (1) penalty point, with an additional penalty point being assessed every two (2) minutes until fifteen (15) minutes after the scheduled start time of the match, up to a maximum of ten (10) penalty points. In this case, the participant will be considered a no-show.

## 10.3. Punctuality at offline matches

Players must arrive at their assigned tournament area no later than fifty (50) minutes before the start of their match, unless otherwise directed by tournament administration. Coaches must arrive at their assigned tournament area no later than thirty (30) minutes before the start of their match, unless otherwise directed by tournament administration.
If a participant knows they will not be able to arrive at their assigned tournament area on time, they must notify tournament administration as soon as possible. Mitigating circumstances and attempts to notify Myskill of the lateness and minimize its consequences may be taken into account when applying penalties. Participants are responsible for monitoring the tournament schedule and any announced changes to avoid lateness.

## 10.4. Lateness at offline matches

In the first case, if a participant fails to arrive at their assigned tournament area within the first ten (10) minutes of their expected arrival time, they will receive a warning.
Thereafter, for every five (5) minutes of delay, the participant will receive one (1) penalty point, up to a maximum of eight (8) penalty points.
If the participant's lateness extends beyond the scheduled match start time, or if a problem arises as a result of the participant's lateness that delays the match start time, such as because the participant is not yet ready to play, participants will be assessed one and a half (1.5) penalty points for every two (2) minutes up to fifteen (15) minutes after the scheduled match start time. The maximum number of penalty points is twelve (12). After this point, the participant will be considered a no-show.

## 10.5. Repeated lateness

If a participant is late for more than two matches in a single competition, they will be considered a repeat offender, and standard penalties will be increased as follows:
Match 3 and subsequent incidents: +100%
If a participant is found to be a repeat offender, they will face more severe penalties at the start of the next Myskill tournament they participate in. The participant will be notified of this before their first match.

## 10.6. No-shows

If a participant is not ready to play within 15 minutes of the scheduled start of a match, they are considered a no-show. In this case, the participant is assessed an additional 5 penalty points on top of the penalty points accrued for being late to the match.
Tournament administration may decide to award a (partial) technical loss if the match consists of more than one map, or to disqualify the participant. After the second 15-minute period, the opponent will be awarded the overall victory in the series. In mitigating circumstances, the match may be rescheduled if the schedule allows.

# 11. Tournament seeding

## 11.1. Definition of “higher seed”

The higher seed is determined by the tournament administration based on qualification performance, regional ranking, VRS, FaceIT seeding or other published criteria.

## 11.2. Seeding based on the Valve regional ranking

If applicable, seeding may follow the official Valve regional ranking. Myskill may adjust seeding to ensure competitive integrity.

# 12. Match protests

## 12.1. Definition

A match protest is a formal request to review a match incident that may have affected the result.

## 12.2. Rules for filing match protests

The protest must contain detailed information about the reason for the protest, how the problem arose, and when it occurred. A protest may be rejected without proper documentation. Only one representative from each team may participate in the protest process. Insults and aggression during a protest are strictly prohibited and may result in penalty points or a decision against the offending party.
Match Protest Deadline
The deadline for participants to file a match protest is the earliest of the following three events:

- Twelve (12) hours after the scheduled start time of the match.
- The start of the next match for either of the two participants.
- For offline events only - at the end of the event day (before the departure of the tournament administration).

# 13. Working with video

In video content (e.g., interviews, featurettes, live camera feeds, etc.) filmed in an environment not controlled by Myskill, the visible environment/background must be neutral, clean, and presentable. Any plans to display sponsors, logos, or advertising (e.g., on a background banner or placed items) must be pre-approved by Myskill.
Explicit promotion of sponsor products (including their consumption) is prohibited. Brand logos must under no circumstances be larger than players' faces on-screen.

## 13.1. Voice communications and recordings

Myskill uses TeamSpeak and Discord for voice communication. Communication during matches is limited to five players per server and one coach.

Staff may connect to the communication channel, but must be passive listeners only (i.e., permanently disconnected). Participants are required to provide TeamSpeak server details upon request and provide full access to tournament administration. Participants will be responsible for the appearance of the TeamSpeak servers they provide, and any inappropriate behavior, language, or content posted on them may be punished. Myskill reserves the right to force the use of one of its servers.
For offline events, Myskill will provide and control a local TeamSpeak or Discord server.
Myskill reserves the right to record all conversations during matches. Tournament administration will connect to the TeamSpeak channel thirty (30) minutes before the start of the match and begin recording conversations fifteen (15) minutes before the start of the match.

## 13.2. Player POV cameras

Each online tournament player is required to have a working webcam and a clear, high-quality video feed.
- Video from the camera must be provided no later than ten (10) minutes before the scheduled match time, before the player connects to the server.
- Players without a working webcam will not be allowed to participate in the match.
- The video feed must remain active throughout the entire map, including the pre-match period.
- Failure to comply with these requirements will automatically disqualify the team or player from the match and may result in further sanctions, including disqualification from the tournament. The following penalties are standard penalties for each missed map:
Team:
20% of the roster without camera: $50 + 0.25% of the prize money winnings
40% of the roster without camera: $100 + 0.5% of the prize money winnings
60% of the roster without camera: $150 + 0.75% of the prize money winnings
80% of the roster without camera: $200 + 1% of the prize money winnings
100% of the roster without camera: $250 + 1.25% of the prize money winnings
Missing coach: additional $50 + 0.25% of the prize money winnings
If a participant fails to comply with their video monitoring obligations in more than two matches within a single competition, they will be considered a repeat offender, and the standard penalties will be increased as follows:
Match 3: +100%
Match 4: +200%
Match 5 and subsequent incidents: +300%
If a participant is found to have violated the rules again, they will face more severe sanctions at the start of the next Myskill tournament they participate in. The participant will be notified of this before their first match.

## 13.3. Player surveillance cameras

For online competitions, players may be required to provide a live camera feed showing their setup, including, but not limited to, their monitor, keyboard, mouse, and surrounding area. Specific requirements will be communicated on a case-by-case basis. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory; failure to comply will result in penalties, including disqualification.

# 14. Tournament area

Only players on the server and the coach specified in the tournament registration form are allowed to communicate in the play area assigned to participants during matches. During online tournaments, additional staff may be present in the play area, but they are prohibited from communicating in any way or entering or leaving the play area during matches. Any electronic devices not provided by the tournament administration are prohibited in the play area, with the exception of cameras and devices used exclusively for communicating with the tournament administration.

## 14.1. Timing

Communications from Myskill (via email, Telegram messenger) that include deadlines are considered an extension of this rulebook and all other Myskill Counter-Strike 2 rulebooks and must be followed as such.

# 15. Substitution rules

## 15.1. Substitutions

If a team is unable to continue participating in the event for any reason, a replacement will be assigned. If this occurs before the replacement deadline, the replacement participant will receive all financial benefits, such as airfare and hotel accommodations allocated to the replaced participant.
Typically, groups or brackets are not reassigned if they were publicly announced before the teams are eliminated. In exceptional cases where the integrity of the competition is at risk, the tournament administration may change the composition of the participants or even conduct a new draw.
Replacement candidates will be reviewed and contacted to determine their willingness to participate.

## 15.2. Replacing a team that qualified through open qualifiers

If a team that qualified through one of the open qualifiers withdraws from the tournament, its slot will be awarded to the next-highest-performing team from the most recent open qualifier in the corresponding region.
For example, if the overall open qualifier winner withdraws from the tournament, the slot will be awarded to the team that lost to the withdrawn team in the open qualifier, but only if the replacement is made two days before the start of the first group stage match.

# 16. Event rules

## 16.1. Equipment

Myskill always provides monitors, computers, SSDs, and noise-canceling headphones.
Participants must bring their own peripherals (specifically: keyboard, mouse, mousepad, in-ear headphones with sufficiently long cables, and sound cards if necessary). All gaming equipment must be approved by tournament administration. Myskill reserves the right to refuse the use of any equipment and/or devices it deems to provide an unfair advantage. Participants may be asked to submit their equipment for additional inspection. Participants wishing to use more than one piece of the same equipment must obtain approval from tournament administration.
Attempting to change any BIOS settings on Myskill-provided computers in tournament or practice areas is strictly prohibited.

## 16.2. Snap Tap ban

Use of Snap Tap, Rappy Snappy, or any similar mechanisms that lead to similar results is strictly prohibited. Failure to comply with this rule may result in penalties ranging from map loss to disqualification from the tournament.

## 16.3. Clothing

Players and teams must wear matching team attire, long pants, and closed-toe shoes (e.g., shorts, flip-flops, and foam clogs like Crocs are prohibited). Headgear of any kind is prohibited. Special exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis for compelling medical or religious reasons. Requests for such exceptions must be submitted directly to tournament administration via email at least 48 hours prior to the start of the competition, unless a medical emergency prevents timely submission. Minor violations of this rule will result in fines (minimum $250), but in serious cases (e.g., offensive content, clothing with another team's logo, etc.), players will not be allowed to start matches until the offending item of clothing is replaced. If possible and deemed appropriate by tournament administration, Myskill will provide appropriate clothing to participants who are inappropriately dressed. The cost of the provided clothing will be deducted from the prize money awarded to participants. Any delay caused by changing clothing will be considered the player's fault and will be penalized according to the punctuality rules.

## 16.4. Following instructions

All tournament instructions must be obeyed. Ignoring directions may result in penalty points.

## 16.5. Tournament briefings

Pre-event player briefings sent by email or Telegram are supplements to these rules and are mandatory.

## 16.6. Technical checklist

After completing the setup process, players must sign a technical checklist. This process is necessary to ensure the integrity of the system used for competition participation before the match begins.
Technical pauses caused by issues that should have been detected had the checklist been properly followed will be penalized with one (1) penalty point, along with any other applicable delay penalties. By signing this document, participants confirm their readiness to begin the match as scheduled. Participants may be forced to start the match even if a technical issue arises that could have been resolved by following the checklist.

## 16.7. Arrival day

Participants must arrive at the participant's hotel by the date designated by Myskill as the "Arrival Date." Failure to arrive on the designated date will incur a minimum fine of $500, which will increase depending on the extent of the disruption to scheduled events. In cases where Myskill deems the reason for the delay unacceptable, disqualification and replacement of the participant may be considered. Penalties will not be assessed if flight delays are due to circumstances beyond the participant's control, or if the participant lives nearby and is not staying at the participant's hotel.
Participants may request an exception via email to arrive on Media Day if their scheduled participation in another LAN event conflicts with the designated arrival date.
However, such exceptions will only be granted if the total number of requests does not impact the integrity of the event. Additionally, Myskill reserves the right to approve an alternative arrival on the first day of the tournament, subject to travel logistics, time estimates, and other operational factors. All requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Participants who have been approved for an alternative arrival date are responsible for covering any additional transportation costs associated with the rescheduled event.

## 16.8. Media obligations

If Myskill decides that one or more players should participate in interviews (short pre-match/post-match interviews and/or longer interview sessions), press conferences, autograph sessions, photo sessions, or video sessions, they may not decline and are required to attend. For all Myskill tournament matches, participants may not decline a request to be interviewed. The interviewee must be a player unless otherwise specifically requested by Myskill. The same interviewee cannot be provided for multiple requests within an event.

Most events will have a mandatory press day, during which participants will be photographed, filmed, and interviewed by Myskill for event promotion.

If necessary, participants will receive a press session schedule in advance to be informed of the nature, duration, and schedule of any such activities that exceed five (5) minutes.

In some cases, participants may be asked to provide materials for use in Myskill-organized broadcasts. Failure to provide them on time upon request will be considered a failure to fulfill an obligation to the media.

## 16.9. Media penalties

Failure to fulfill media obligations will result in penalties. The amount of these penalties varies depending on the situation. Below are the standard penalties for the most common cases:
Failure to appear on time and in full for press day: $500 + 5% of the prize money

## 16.10. Partial attendance or lateness to an autograph session:

1-30% of the lineup absent: $600 + 0.75% of the prize money winnings
31-50% of the lineup absent: $800 + 1% of the prize money winnings
51-70% of the lineup absent: $1,000 + 1.25% of the prize money winnings
71-99% of the lineup absent: $1,200 + 1.5% of the prize money winnings
100% of the lineup absent: $2,000 + 2.5% of the prize money winnings

## 16.11. Late or incomplete press conference attendance:

31-50% of the lineup absent: $480 + 0.6% of the prize money winnings
51-70% of the lineup absent: $600 + 0.75% of the prize money winnings
71-99% of the lineup absent: $720 + 0.9% of the prize money winnings
100% of the lineup absent: $1200 + 1.5% of the prize money winnings
Similar penalties will apply for failure to fulfill other comparable media-related obligations. Penalties may be reduced if the participant arrives late, but early enough to create the required content/conduct an acceptable session. Fines may also be reduced if the Participant can provide evidence of mitigating circumstances. This decision is made by the tournament administration independently.

## 16.12. Stage matches

Participants must play all stage matches they reach. No exceptions are allowed.

## 16.13. Food, drinks, smoking and behaviour

Unless announced otherwise, food is not allowed in tournament areas. Smoking and vaping are banned. Drinks are permitted only in Myskill-provided containers and must be kept under the table if not stated otherwise. Excessive noise and offensive language are prohibited.

## 16.14. Electronic devices

Connecting or using any electronic devices (e.g., phones, cameras, vaporizers, tablets, hand warmers, etc.) to tournament computers without prior inspection and approval from tournament administrators is strictly prohibited. Participants are prohibited from bringing any electronic devices, cameras, or similar devices (e.g., vaporizers) into the tournament area without permission from tournament administration. Such devices must be returned to tournament administration prior to the start of the match. Participants are prohibited from taking photographs and/or recording any notes on stage.

## 16.15. Unnecessary items

Items that are not currently necessary (e.g., clothing not being worn, bags, etc.) should be stored out of view of broadcast cameras.
Paper copies of tactical documents may be placed on desks in reasonable sizes and quantities (e.g., a notepad, a stack of A4 paper no larger than 20 sheets).

## 16.16. Setup period

A thirty (30) minute setup period is typically provided before a live match, including installing peripherals, settings, and warming up, although this period is not guaranteed.
The exact setup time will be communicated to teams upon arrival at the tournament venue.
Both teams will be given equal setup time and will only be permitted to enter the tournament area at the same time. An exception is the case of one (1) team member arriving late for reasons beyond their control.
Any time spent outside the tournament playing area during this thirty (30) minute period will continue to count toward the setup time. At the discretion of the Head Referee, additional setup time may be granted if a technical issue arises that was not foreseeable in advance. Any technical issues caused by a player's equipment (e.g. peripherals or in-ear headphones) will not result in additional preparation time being granted, nor will technical issues that arise after a player has chosen not to begin preparation when the tournament area is open to them.
