# 1. Scope of this Rulebook

The event is organised by the tournament operator Myskill (referred to in this document as “Myskill” and/or the “organiser”) and its affiliated parties.

This rulebook is part of the Myskill Counter-Strike 2 regulations. It applies to Myskill tournaments, their participants and every match played within these competitions. By taking part, participants confirm that they understand and accept all rules.

The regulations consist of three documents:

- Myskill Counter-Strike 2 Rulebook
- Myskill Counter-Strike in-game rules
- Myskill Counter-Strike roster regulations

# 2. Participants

A participant is a team or player competing in a Myskill tournament.

Any member of a team competing in a Myskill tournament is considered part of that team regardless of whether they have played a match for it. No participant may be part of multiple organisations that are taking part in overlapping Myskill Counter-Strike competitions.

In exceptional circumstances, a transition period may be granted that allows a participant to finish one competition with their current team while beginning another with a different team.

If you are unsure, contact a tournament administrator to confirm whether a given competition creates a conflict of interest.

# 3. Penalties
## 3.1. Definitions and scope of penalties

Participants may receive penalties for rule infractions during an event. Possible sanctions include penalty points, fines, default losses, disqualification of a player or team, or a combination of these measures depending on the incident. Participants are informed about penalties by email and are given a deadline to appeal. Only the team representative or their appointed delegate may file an appeal.

## 3.2. Penalty points

Penalty points may be issued for competition-related incidents. Each point deducts one percent (1%) of the prize money a participant earns in the competition.

## 3.3. Fines

Fines may be imposed for match-related incidents as well as for failing to meet obligations outside the competition itself, such as media appointments or scheduled fan interactions. If the total fines exceed the prize money earned at the event, the team and/or participant will receive an invoice for the remaining balance.

## 3.4. Bans / suspensions

Severe violations may result in bans or suspensions. These can apply to a participant or to an organisation.

## 3.5. Disqualification

In the most serious cases, participants may be disqualified from the event. Disqualified participants forfeit all prize money earned in the respective competition. The organisation, team and its members are barred from continuing in that competition.

## 3.6. Additional disciplinary measures

In special cases, the tournament administration may determine and apply disciplinary measures not explicitly listed in the Myskill Counter-Strike rules.

## 3.7. Repeated offences

All penalties in this rulebook apply to first offences. Repeat offences are generally punished more severely than indicated in the relevant section.

## 3.8. External bans and penalty points

League bans and penalty points issued outside the Myskill Counter-Strike ecosystem usually do not apply to Myskill events unless they were imposed for cheating. Other serious violations (such as unsportsmanlike conduct or fraud) may also be sanctioned depending on their severity.

# 4. General rules

## 4.1. Rule changes

Myskill reserves the right to amend, remove or otherwise change rules without prior notice. Myskill may also rule on matters not covered by the regulations to uphold fair competition and sportsmanship.

## 4.2. Validity of rules

If any provision of this rulebook is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, this does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or in any other jurisdiction.

## 4.3. Local laws

If a rule or procedure conflicts with local laws, it will be adjusted to comply with the law while staying as close as possible to the intended effect.

## 4.4. Confidentiality

Emails, communication channels, discussions and any other correspondence with officials or tournament administrators are strictly confidential.

Publishing such material is prohibited without the written consent of the tournament administration.

## 4.5. Supplemental agreements

The tournament administration is not responsible for additional agreements and will not enforce arrangements made between participants. Myskill strongly discourages such agreements, and any deal that contradicts the Myskill Counter-Strike rules is prohibited under all circumstances.

# 5. Match broadcasts

## 5.1. Rights

Unless otherwise stated in event supplements, all broadcasting rights for Myskill tournaments belong to Myskill. This includes, but is not limited to, IRC bots, video streams (such as POV broadcasts), CSTV, replays, demos and television broadcasts.

## 5.2. Waiving broadcasting rights

Myskill may grant the broadcasting rights of one or more matches to a third party or to the participants themselves. In these cases, the broadcast must be approved by the Myskill tournament administration at least twenty-four (24) hours before the match starts.

## 5.3. Responsibility of participants

Participants may not refuse to broadcast their matches on channels authorised by Myskill, nor may they choose the broadcast method. Only the tournament administration may allow a match to go unbroadcast. Participants agree to provide all conditions required to produce the broadcast.

# 6. Communication

Email and the Telegram messenger are the primary communication channels for Myskill Counter-Strike tournaments. The tournament administration will use the contact email addresses and Telegram accounts provided by participants.

Discord servers may also be used in online competitions to coordinate matches, manage broadcasts and organise activities. In such cases, the tournament administration will email the relevant server details.

# 7. Eligibility requirements

**The following requirements must be met to take part in the event:**

## 7.1. Age requirements

All participants must be at least sixteen (16) years old by the first mandatory day of the competition, including media days and qualifiers.

## 7.2. Country / region of origin

A team’s home region (Central Asia or Rest of the World) is determined by the location of all of its players during the tournament and its qualifiers.

Two (2) regions are defined for the tournament: Central Asia and Rest of the World.
# 8. Player data

Players must provide any information requested by Myskill, including full name, contact details, date of birth, address, game account and a photograph.

## 8.1. Nicknames

Players may only use their official nicknames (without additions) in Myskill matches. Players with a Valve-registered nickname for sponsored events or an HLTV page must use the same nickname in all Myskill matches.

Players without a registered nickname may request a change by emailing the tournament administration. Myskill may reject nicknames containing political, religious or offensive content or anything that violates the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

## 8.2. Game accounts

Participants must supply their game account details when applying to enter or on the FACEIT registration page for the event. They must not use any account other than the one submitted for registration.

### Application requirements

Standard applications must include:

- Team name and abbreviation
- Team logo (if requested)
- Contact person and details
- Starting line-up
- Substitute players

Myskill may request additional information. Failure to provide required data may result in exclusion from the tournament.

### Team names

Team names may not include extensions such as “CS team”. They may only contain the team name and, if permitted, the title sponsor. Myskill reserves the right to shorten team names when necessary or appropriate.

Myskill may reject names containing political, religious or offensive content or anything that violates the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

## 8.3. Title sponsors

Myskill may allow a team to include a title sponsor in its name only if the entire organisation changes its name. Participants must contact Myskill directly to request a name change. Requests are evaluated under the following rules:

- The request must be submitted by the roster deadline of the first tournament that should use the new name.
- The organisation must officially adopt the new name and include the title partner in it.
- The organisation must use the new name in all communications and assets.
- All social media channels must be updated with the new name.
- The organisation must use the new name in every event it attends, not just Myskill tournaments.

Each title sponsor may appear in the name of only one organisation participating in the tournament. Only the actual name of the partner is allowed; product descriptions and similar additions are not permitted.

A request to add a title sponsor may be submitted only once within twelve (12) months. Myskill may decline any request at its sole discretion. Participants should consult Myskill to confirm whether a partner is eligible to be included in the organisation’s name.

## 8.4. Team logos

Team logos must not include the logos or iconography of brands, teams or trademarks unrelated to the team unless they belong to an approved title sponsor.

Copyrighted material may only be used with documented permission from the rights holder. Myskill may reject logos that contain political, religious or offensive statements or anything that violates the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

## 8.5. Roster or team changes

Any roster changes must be approved by the tournament administration before they take effect. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Adding or removing players
- Changing the team name
- Changing the team logo

## 8.6. Permission to participate

Before each event, Myskill may issue participation licences to players or teams. These are generally granted to participants who meet one or more of the following criteria:

- Qualified through Myskill regional qualifiers
- Received a direct invitation from the organiser
- Earned a slot via other tournaments or events

## 8.7. Duration

A Myskill licence is valid only for the event for which it is issued.

## 8.8. Team licence

Event licences are issued to legal entities (registered associations, organisations, LLCs, etc.). A legal entity may hold only one licence per competition, and an organisation may field only one roster in the tournament. Teams are strictly forbidden from switching the line-up that represents them during the event.

If a team does not have a legal entity or has not previously reported it to and received approval from the tournament administration, it may receive a limited licence with a team manager or organiser designated as the point of contact. This person is responsible for keeping the team information up to date.

Regardless of licence type, it remains valid only if the majority of the players who qualified or participated in the tournament or qualifiers stay with the team.

If a team has used more than five players during the qualifiers, it must ensure that at least five players from the qualifying roster remain on the team. Additional players may be registered as substitutes if they meet the eligibility criteria.

## 8.9. Transfer of licence ownership

Licences may not be transferred to another legal entity or organisation without written approval from Myskill. Any change of ownership must be reported immediately and may lead to the licence being revoked.

## 8.10. Revoking a licence

Myskill may revoke a licence if the organisation or team breaches the rulebook, fails to meet eligibility requirements or violates applicable laws. In severe cases, the team may be removed from the tournament.

## 8.11. Conflict of interest

Players, coaches and managers must disclose any situations that could create a conflict of interest, such as involvement with multiple organisations or business relationships with other teams. Myskill may impose additional restrictions or deny participation if a conflict of interest is identified.
# 9. Prize money

Prize payments are ideally processed within ninety (90) days after a Myskill event ends, but may take up to one hundred eighty (180) days. Payments will be delayed if accurate billing information, invoices or required documents (including tax forms) are missing.

## 9.1. Prize deductions resulting from penalties

Each penalty point earned during the tournament or its qualifiers removes one percent (1%) of the participant’s prize share. The deduction is calculated from the total prize money awarded for the latest phase of the competition, excluding travel stipends or club fees. The deducted amount is redistributed among the remaining teams. Monetary fines are deducted from the penalised team’s prize share and are not redistributed.

## 9.2. Withholding prize money

Until prize money is paid out, Myskill may cancel any pending payment if evidence of cheating or fraud emerges.

## 9.3. Prize money and ongoing investigations

If a player is under investigation when prize money is due, their payment is postponed until the investigation ends. If the investigation concludes after three years but the player is entitled to prize money, it will still be paid.

## 9.4. Transfer of prize money

Prize money is paid via bank transfer or another method specified by the tournament administration, following the instructions of the licence holder. Unclaimed prizes expire one year after the initial payout date.

## 9.5. Declining to participate

Teams that leave the tournament between stages (including qualifiers and the main event) or after accepting an invitation forfeit all prize money earned and receive a ban from the next event of the same level. They may also be fined to cover replacement costs (travel for the replacement team and other expenses). If Myskill cannot find a replacement, the team’s scheduled matches are voided. Fines may be waived in emergencies such as medical issues or visa problems, provided the team supplies appropriate documentation.

## 9.6. Leaving the event during playoffs

A team that forfeits a playoff elimination match is considered to have left the tournament. If the forfeit happens before the first playoff round, the next best-ranked team from the previous stage replaces them. Later forfeits award the withdrawing team the placement held in the bracket at the time of withdrawal, but only half of the associated prize money, and the team loses eligibility for further rewards. In league formats, withdrawing from playoffs may lead to relegation.

## 9.7. Removal of match results

All matches played by players who leave a tournament stage after it has started are removed from the standings. In playoffs, the withdrawing team’s next scheduled match is recorded as a forfeit win for the opponent.

# 10. Match start

## 10.1. Punctuality in online matches

Teams must be present on the match server at the scheduled start time. Match channels must be joined at least fifteen (15) minutes before the match.

## 10.2. Lateness in online matches

If a team is late, the opponent must notify an admin immediately. After fifteen (15) minutes, the admin may award a default win. Repeated lateness is treated as unsportsmanlike behaviour and may result in penalty points or fines.

## 10.3. Punctuality at offline matches

Teams must arrive at the venue at the times set by the tournament administration. Being ready on stage at the assigned call time is mandatory.

## 10.4. Lateness at offline matches

If a team is late for an offline call time, penalties can include map losses, fines or disqualification, depending on the delay and circumstances.

## 10.5. Repeated lateness

Repeated lateness increases the severity of sanctions and may lead to removal from the tournament.

## 10.6. No-shows

Failure to show up without notifying the administration results in disqualification, loss of prize money and possible bans from future events.

# 11. Tournament seeding

## 11.1. Definition of “higher seed”

The higher seed is determined by the tournament administration based on qualification performance, regional ranking or other published criteria.

## 11.2. Seeding based on the Valve regional ranking

If applicable, seeding may follow the official Valve regional ranking. Myskill may adjust seeding to ensure competitive integrity.

# 12. Match protests

## 12.1. Definition

A match protest is a formal request to review a match incident that may have affected the result.

## 12.2. Rules for filing match protests

Protests must be submitted within thirty (30) minutes after the match ends, including evidence and a clear description of the issue. Only the team representative may file a protest. The administration’s decision is final.

# 13. Working with video

## 13.1. Voice communications and recordings

Teams must record their voice communications if requested and provide the recordings to the administration. Unauthorized publication of these recordings is prohibited.

## 13.2. Player POV cameras

Players must enable POV cameras when requested for broadcasts or reviews. The administration will provide setup instructions.

## 13.3. Player surveillance cameras

On-site events may use external cameras to monitor players. Participants must comply with placement and operating instructions.

# 14. Tournament area

## 14.1. Timing

Only players, coaches and authorised staff may access the tournament area at designated times. Teams must follow all access instructions from officials.

# 15. Substitution rules

## 15.1. Substitutions

All substitutions must be approved by the administration and may only involve registered players. Substitutes must be ready to play without delaying the schedule.

## 15.2. Replacing a team that qualified through open qualifiers

If a qualified team cannot participate, the administration may invite the next best team from the qualifier or another suitable replacement. Replacement teams must meet all eligibility requirements.
# 16. Event rules

## 16.1. Equipment

Myskill provides monitors, PCs, SSDs and noise-cancelling headsets. Players must bring their own peripherals (keyboard, mouse, mousepad, in-ear headset with long cables and, if needed, a sound card). All gear must be approved by the administration, which may refuse any device that offers an unfair advantage. BIOS settings on tournament or practice PCs may not be changed.

## 16.2. Snap Tap ban

Snap Tap, Rappy Snappy and similar features are strictly forbidden. Violations can result in map forfeits or disqualification.

## 16.3. Configurations and drivers

Participants must submit their configs and required drivers (software names and version numbers) by the deadline set before the event. Late submissions may force players to configure settings on site using default drivers without additional setup time.

## 16.4.–16.6. CS2 files

Only the following configuration files may be provided:

- `Steam\userdata\YOUR_ID\730\local\cfg\cs2_machine_convars.vcfg`
- `Steam\userdata\YOUR_ID\730\local\cfg\cs2_user_convars_0_slot0.vcfg`
- `userdata\YOUR_ID\730\local\cfg\cs2_user_keys_0_slot0.vcfg`
- `userdata\YOUR_ID\730\local\cfg\cs2_video.txt`

Players may additionally submit a text file describing launch options or GPU/monitor settings.

## 16.7. Clothing

Teams must wear matching uniforms, long trousers and closed shoes. Headwear is prohibited unless the administration grants an exemption for medical or religious reasons (requests must be submitted at least 48 hours before the event). Minor violations incur fines of at least 250 USD; serious cases (offensive imagery, other team logos) prevent players from starting until the issue is resolved. Myskill may provide replacement clothing and deduct its cost from prize money. Delays caused by changing clothes count as player errors and may be penalised for lateness.

## 16.8. Following instructions

All tournament instructions must be obeyed. Ignoring directions may result in penalty points.

## 16.9. Tournament briefings

Pre-event player briefings sent by email are supplements to these rules and are mandatory.

## 16.10. Technical checklist

After setup, players must sign the technical checklist confirming readiness. Technical pauses caused by issues that should have been detected via the checklist incur one (1) penalty point and additional delay penalties. Matches may start even if problems arise that could have been addressed during the checklist procedure.

## 16.11. Arrival day

Participants must check into the tournament hotel on the specified arrival date. Missing the date triggers a minimum 500 USD fine and may lead to disqualification if the delay disrupts operations. Flight delays outside the participant’s control and local residents not staying at the hotel are exempt. Exceptions for media-day arrivals or first-day appearances are granted only if logistics allow, and approved teams bear any additional travel costs.

## 16.12. Media obligations

Players must attend interviews, press conferences, autograph sessions, photo shoots and video shoots when requested. Interviewees must be players unless Myskill specifies otherwise, and different interviews require different players. Most events include a mandatory press day. Schedules are provided in advance for activities lasting more than five minutes. Requested promotional materials must be submitted on time.

## 16.13–16.15. Media penalties

Missing media obligations incurs fines. Typical penalties include:

- Press day absence: 500 USD + 5% of prize winnings
- Autograph session: from 600 USD + 0.75% (1–30% of roster absent) up to 2000 USD + 2.5% (entire roster absent)
- Press conference: from 360 USD + 0.45% up to 1200 USD + 1.5%, depending on the percentage of absent players

Comparable penalties apply to similar obligations. Fines may be reduced if the team arrives late but still completes the activity or can show mitigating circumstances.

## 16.16. Stage matches

Participants must play all stage matches they reach. No exceptions are allowed.

## 16.17. Food, drinks, smoking and behaviour

Unless announced otherwise, food is not allowed in tournament areas. Smoking and vaping are banned. Drinks are permitted only in Myskill-provided containers and must be kept under the table if not stated otherwise. Excessive noise and offensive language are prohibited.

## 16.18. Electronic devices

Electronic devices (phones, cameras, vapes, tablets, hand warmers, etc.) may not be connected to tournament PCs or brought into the area without prior inspection and approval. Disallowed devices must be surrendered before the match. Taking photos or recordings on stage is forbidden.

## 16.19. Unnecessary items

Unneeded items (bags, spare clothing, etc.) should be kept out of sight. Reasonable tactical notes (e.g., notebooks or up to 20 sheets of A4 paper) may be placed on the desks.

## 16.20. Warm-up period

Offline matches usually include a thirty (30) minute warm-up period for setting up peripherals and warming up, although it is not guaranteed. Teams receive the exact schedule upon arrival. Both teams are granted equal setup time and may enter the area only together, except when a participant is late for reasons beyond their control. Time spent outside the area still counts toward the warm-up. Additional time may be granted at the head referee’s discretion for unforeseeable technical issues, but problems caused by personal equipment or by delaying the start voluntarily do not justify extra time.

## 16.21. Rights to photos and other media

By attending the event, all team members grant Myskill the right to use any photos, audio or video captured for promotional purposes.

## 16.22. Award ceremony

Participants must remain at the venue for the trophy ceremony after the grand final.

## 16.23. Areas provided by Myskill

Participants must respect all restrictions at the venue, hotel and host country when access is granted by Myskill. Only Myskill-approved marketing activities are allowed in these areas.
